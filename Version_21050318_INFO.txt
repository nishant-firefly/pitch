Version Number: 20140730


Existing Features (from previous versions):
- Data fills (table and graph) only as the particular page loads (not on Pitch open)
- Loading Screen
- Multi-Selects filter on Close
- Generics-Ready Divs = Divs can be filled with a multi-column data object. (Supposed to be one record, single-column referenced)
- Graphs work on first page
- Multi-Graphs on the same page.
- SmartText = A single drop-down controls both a graph display and a table (special for Pepsi)
- Generics-ready "highlight data" = Ability to reference a multi-column data object when refering to the match-field for highlight.
- Table Overload function ("populate_table_overload") = This is a common function called when a table is displayed. It should be added to the Team Toolbox. It allows for math recalculation on Table display (esp. for saved values). 
- Added a file to the source files that includes several key "common" functions for Team Toolboxes. See scripts/CommonFunctions.txt for more info.
- Dynamic Column Headers for JQuery-driven tables. 
- Explicitly specify the standard outside border of tables as grey.
- Modified SFPresentation.js with line of code for transition from Touch 3 to Touch 4.
- Modified coremain.js in regards to the filtering of both muliselect and radio buttons on multiple targets.
- Multi-filter did not work on initial table load. This has been fixed.

New Features (to move up on next version):
- Code update for Touch 4 bread crumb issue
- Main.js(ChangeColor Function) and ClearAll functions altered to allow for coloring of cells within tables with use of class name "colorColumn"

Bugs Fixed (remove these each version):










Clarifications (keep these here):
- Graphs MUST use numbers for values. Otherwise the Scale will be off.
- When designing tables, make sure the table has side borders, then run the columns accross, the slider will be crushed into the last column.
